/*
 * README.android describes in high-level the LLVM changes that we cannot push
 * upstream to the llvm.org repository:
 *  - Changes due to Android's build system.
 *  - Changes due to Android's toolchain.
 *  - Changes due to the limitations in Android-based consumer electronics.
 *
 * Some of them are to-dos. If and when they are done, there will no longer be 
 * merge conflicts with upstream on those parts.
 *
 * The file contains useful hints when we try to resolve future 3-way merge 
 * conflicts.

* For Honeycomb: Synced to upstream r112344.
* For Honeycomb MR1: Synced to upstream r119309
* For Honeycomb MR2: Synced to upstream r119309
* For Ice Cream Sandwich: Synced to upstream r133718

* Recent update #1: From r133240 to 133718
* Recent update #2: From r129128 to 133240
* Recent update #3: From r127116 to 129128
* Recent update #4: From r119309 to 127116

* We add 40+ Android's *.mk files that are specific to Android's build system.

* All the configuration files because we don't have configure/make/make-install

* Changes for enabling both host and device builds.

* All the tblgen work to enable Android to build a generator-generator binary
  and then run it in the middle of Android build process.

* Explicitly include <cctype> header since is*() are not builtin functions in 
Android toolchain.

* Code changes to make Android's toolchain stop outputting warnings. (This part
  should be pushed upstream eventually.)

* lib/Target/{X86,ARM}/AsmPrinter/{X86,ARM}AsmPrinter.cpp
   Move from lib/Target/{X86,ARM}/{X86,ARM}AsmPrinter.cpp. 
   AsmPrinter is only needed in Android when disassembly functionality 
      is desired to be included.

* Our ARM code generation fixes that upstream hasn't accepted yet. (This
  conflict will be resolved eventually, but there will always be time lag.)

* Assorted size optimizations because Android-based consumer electronics
  need them.
